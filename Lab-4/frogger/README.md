# Frogger Lab

## 1. Game Introduction

This is a **Pygame-based Frogger game** created for the Vibe Coding lab.

The lab focuses on understanding an existing game, debugging issues, and adding new functionality using AI-assisted development while critically reviewing and testing AI-generated code.

---

## 2. What Is Provided

The starter project includes:

- A playable frog controlled using the arrow keys
- Moving vehicles across multiple road lanes
- A goal zone and starting zone
- Basic game rendering and game loop
- Restart functionality using `R`
- One existing bug
- Basic functionality required for the remaining features

Use an LLM such as ChatGPT or Claude as a debugging and pair-programming assistant. You are responsible for reviewing, testing, and validating any generated code.

## 3. Tasks

### Task 1 — Fix Vehicle Collision Detection

Fix the existing vehicle collision behaviour so that collisions are detected correctly.

### Task 2 — Implement Lives and Respawn

Add a 3-life system with appropriate frog respawn behaviour after a collision.

### Task 3 — Implement Goal and Score Tracking

Detect successful goal completion and implement score tracking with an appropriate win state.

### Task 4 — Add a 30-Second Timer

Add a 30-second countdown for each attempt and handle timeout appropriately.

## 4. Expected Behaviour

- The frog moves correctly using the arrow keys.
- Vehicle collisions are detected reliably.
- The player has 3 lives.
- The frog respawns appropriately after losing a life.
- Reaching the goal results in a win.
- The current score is displayed during gameplay.
- Each attempt has a 30-second time limit.
- Running out of time has an appropriate effect on the current attempt.
- Losing all lives results in Game Over.
- Pressing `R` restarts the game.
